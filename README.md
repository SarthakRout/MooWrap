# MooWrap
This is a wrapper for MooKIT - IITK to provide additional functionality.

Work to Do:
 - Understand how these extensions work
 - Get a list of all courses
 - Get a list of summary APIs to call and request headers that we require
 - Get those request headers from cookie and save them locally.
 - Create a data structure to see how the summary APIs change during a visit to next. Maybe we can track by the username
 - Link it to Firebase and send request (Is it CrossOriginXHR ?)
 - Whenever we find change, we put some marker on that course through contentscript.js and in the popup.js.
 - I think we are done then !
